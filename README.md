# Bookshop-Program
My project is a Book Shop program where I give the user a Menu with options that they would typically have at any Bookstore. 



I started this project by creating a list of books while trying to decide what information would be most relevant to the user - I decided on the Book Title, Author, and Price.



I stored my books into a linked list and to make things easier for myself I created a CSV file: this file easily and efficiently stored the book information throughout the program.



My first goal was to grab the book information from the CSV file through my main function.



When I realized that I would need a Menu with different options for the user coming to the Book Shop, I decided to move the code in my main function to my display books function for a display books option. 



This part was tricky because I was trying to do two things at once: move my code from one function to another while creating a menu in my main. 



After watching videos and still confused, I looked back at my PLP and relearned how to use cases - I was able to implement this for my menu and my displaybooks function was working fine.



Now that I had one of my functions working I began to brainstorm a list of functions that would be suitable for my program (display books -which I already had, recommendations, add book, buy book, and a leave store option).



I was very ambitious at first and wanted to also create a return book, search book etc. but I didn't realize how time consuming it was to learn how to write each function- they are each different in their own way.



For my recommendations function I started off by printing out 2 books in which I already had in the csv file - once this worked I created a linked list in the book node of the book recommendations and using basic pointers as well as a separate function to print out the information about the recommended books.



For my add books function I was able to add books to my csv file which would then show up after re-running the code and choosing the display books option. At this point my laptop was not letting me choose option 1 but after troubleshooting I was able to get back on track.



For my buybook i called the display book function to show the book options and refer to the CSV as usual to see if the book is available, or isn't and used a boolean - I was stuck on this because I didnâ€™t know how the buy book option would work - but i decided to keep it simple by printing a statement.



My highlights are that it works well and that there are a number of easy and specific options. 



This project was definitely challenging and it pushed me to research on my own, troubleshoot, and repeat. I am proud of my final product after having learned new C++ coding skills through working on this project this semester.
